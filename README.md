Test task from Integrity

We have provided a file called “words.txt” which contains a sorted list of
approximately 173,000 words. The words are listed one word per line, do not contain spaces,
and are all lowercase.
Your task is to write a program that reads the file and provides the following:
❖ the longest concatenated word (that is, the longest word that is comprised entirely of
shorter words in the file)
❖ the 2nd longest concatenated word
❖ the total count of all the concatenated words in the file
